# Next steps

## Introduction

I wrote this as if these were clearly dsitrinct steps, they're not.

iterative nature of ML lifecycle, add a tip 

the value of delivering something, and avoid endless optimization 

## Potential future work

### Data ingestion 

explore other data sources, like meteo data

### EDA

### Modelling

optuna, shap values

### industrialization

rely on Github actions and webhooks to automatize deployment 

develop the MLOps aspect, MLFlow as model registery, deeper model monitoring 

## Conclusion

i loved doing this.
