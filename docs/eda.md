# :fontawesome-solid-vial: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Now that we have access to our data source, let's explore it.
We must ensure we have a good understanding of what the data is -- and isn't -- before we can explore modelling options.

In other words, let's dive into the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.

## Duplicates and missing values

## Plot the data

## Seasonality
