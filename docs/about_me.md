I'm a data scientist passionate about solving problems through data and code.<br>
On the day to day, I apply this passion [Synotis](www.synotis.ch), where I help clients solve problems leveraging ML-based approaches.

This same passion spawned this project, and I had a blast building it.

You can find out more about me on my [website](https://arthurgassner.ch), [GitHub](https://github.com/arthurgassner) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthur-gassner/).

Feel free to reach out to me directly via [email](mailto:arth.gassner@gmail.com)!
